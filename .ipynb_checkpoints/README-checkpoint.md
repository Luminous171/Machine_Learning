### Part 1: Analysis

Technique with the best balanced accuracy score: 0.73 Random Over Sampling (Naive Oversampling).

Technique with the best recall score: 0.77 Random Over Sampling (Naive Oversampling).

Technique with the best geometric mean score: 0.73 Random Over Sampling (Naive Oversampling).

### Part 2: Analysis

Testing two ensemble machine learning algorithms to see if the results improve.

Technique with the best balanced accuracy score: 0.76 Easy Ensemble Classifier (balanced bootstrap achieved through random under sampling).

Technique with the best recall score: 0.85 Balanced Random Forest Classifier (balanced bootstrap achieved through random under sampling).

Technique with the best geometric mean score: 0.76 Easy Ensemble Classifier (balanced bootstrap achieved through random under sampling).

The top three features:
1. Outstanding Principle Inv (invested?)
2. Total Interest Received
3. Total acc (account?)
